\title{Calculate SSpop/SStotal Plasticity Ratio for Multiple Traits}
\usage{
calculate_Plasticity_Ratio(data, env_col, trait_cols, pop_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the trait measurements, environment labels, and population labels.}

\item{env_col}{Either the name or index of the column in `data` that holds environment labels,
or an external vector of length `nrow(data)` specifying environment membership.}

\item{trait_cols}{A vector of column names or indices in `data` corresponding to the traits
for which to compute the plasticity ratio.}

\item{pop_col}{Either the name or index of the column in `data` that holds population labels,
or an external vector of length `nrow(data)` specifying population membership.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector, one entry per trait in `trait_cols`, giving
\eqn{SSpop / SStotal} for that trait.
}
\description{
Computes the plasticity ratio for each specified trait, defined as the
proportion of variance attributable to population differences (SSpop)
relative to the total phenotypic variance (SStotal) across environments.
Internally, a two‚Äêfactor ANOVA (population + environment) is fitted and
the ratio of the population sum of squares to the total sum of squares is returned.
