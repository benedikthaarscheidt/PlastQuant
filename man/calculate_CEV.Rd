\title{Calculate Coefficient of Environmental Variation (CEV) for a Single Trait}
\usage{
calculate_CEV(trait_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{A numeric vector of trait values for a single trait (each value measured in an
environment, assumed equidistant).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `CEV`: The calculated Coefficient of Environmental Variation.
  - `Mean`: The mean of the trait values.
  - `SD`: The standard deviation of the trait values.
  - `Valid`: Logical indicating whether the calculation was successful.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Coefficient of Environmental Variation (CEV) for a single trait,
given a numeric vector of trait values measured across environments. If the environmental values
are not provided, they are assumed to be equidistant.
}
\details{
The formula used is:
\deqn{CEV = \frac{Standard\ Deviation}{Mean} \times 100}
}
\examples{
trait_values = c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
result = calculate_CEV(trait_values)
print(result)

}
