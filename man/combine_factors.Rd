\title{Combine Internal and External Factors into a Single Dataframe and Return Levels}
\usage{
combine_factors(dataframe, factors = NULL, factors_not_in_dataframe = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{A data.frame containing the observations.}

\item{factors}{(Optional) Character or integer vector naming the columns in
`dataframe` to use as internal factors.}

\item{factors_not_in_dataframe}{(Optional) A list of external vectors (each length `nrow(dataframe)`)
to include as additional factors in the interaction.}
}
\value{
The original `dataframe`, now with a new factor column
  `Combined_Factors`.  The function also prints the levels of
  `Combined_Factors` to the console.
}
\description{
Combines specified internal factor columns (in the data frame) and/or
external vectors into one interaction factor.  A new column,
`Combined_Factors`, is added to the data frame holding this interaction,
and its levels are printed.
}
\examples{
# Only internal factors
df <- data.frame(
  Light = rep(c("Low", "High"), each = 3),
  Water = rep(c("Dry", "Wet"), times = 3)
)
combine_factors(df, factors = c("Light", "Water"))

# Only external factors
ext1 <- rep(c("A", "B"), each = 3)
combine_factors(df, factors_not_in_dataframe = list(ext1))

# Both internal and external
combine_factors(df,
  factors = "Light",
  factors_not_in_dataframe = list(ext1)
)

}
