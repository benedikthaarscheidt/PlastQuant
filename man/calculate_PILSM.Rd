\title{Proportional Inter‑Least‑Square Mean Difference (PILSM)}
\usage{
calculate_PILSM(trait_values, env = NULL, covariates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{Numeric vector of trait measurements.}

\item{env}{Vector (numeric, character, or factor) indicating the environment for each observation.}

\item{covariates}{Optional numeric vector or data frame of covariate values to include in the model.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value:
  \deqn{\frac{\max(\hat{\mu}_e) - \min(\hat{\mu}_e)}{\max(\hat{\mu}_e)}},
  where \(\hat{\mu}_e\) are the estimated least‑square means for each environment.
}
\description{
Computes the Proportional Inter‑Least‑Square Mean Difference (PILSM), defined as the
difference between the maximum and minimum least‑square means (LSMs) of a trait across
environments, divided by the maximum LSM.
}
\examples{
trait_values <- c(
  rep(10:14, each = 1),
  rep(20:24, each = 1),
  rep(30:34, each = 1)
)
env <- factor(rep(c("Env1", "Env2", "Env3"), each = 5))
covariates <- data.frame(SoilQuality = rep(c(3, 4, 5), each = 5))

# Without covariates
calculate_PILSM(trait_values, env)

# With covariates
calculate_PILSM(trait_values, env, covariates)
