\title{Phenotypic Plasticity Index (Pi)}
\usage{
calculate_Phenotypic_Plasticity_Index(data, trait_cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector, or a data frame / matrix where each column is a trait.}

\item{trait_cols}{(Optional) A vector of column names or indices indicating which columns of `data`
to analyze.  If `NULL` (the default), `data` must be a numeric vector and Pi is
calculated for that vector.}
}
\value{
- If `trait_cols = NULL`, a single numeric value: Pi for the input vector.
  - Otherwise, a named numeric vector of Pi values, one per specified column.
}
\description{
Calculates the Phenotypic Plasticity Index (Pi), defined as the difference between
the maximum and minimum values of a trait divided by the maximum value.  Pi may be
computed on a single numeric vector or on specified columns of a data frame or matrix.
}
\examples{
# Single-vector mode
x <- c(5, 8, 12, 7, 10)
calculate_Phenotypic_Plasticity_Index(x)

# Data-frame mode
df <- data.frame(
  Height = c(10, 15, 12, 14, 18),
  Width  = c(20, 25, 22, 23, 27),
  Depth  = c(30, 35, 32, 34, 37)
)
# Compute Pi for Height and Width only
calculate_Phenotypic_Plasticity_Index(df, trait_cols = c("Height", "Width"))
