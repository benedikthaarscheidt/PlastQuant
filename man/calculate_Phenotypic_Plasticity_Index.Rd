\title{Calculate the Phenotypic Plasticity Index (Pi)}
\usage{
calculate_Phenotypic_Plasticity_Index(data, trait_cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector, data frame, or matrix containing the trait data.
If a data frame or matrix is provided, each column represents a trait.}

\item{trait_cols}{(Optional) A vector of column numbers or names of the traits to analyze
if `data` is a data frame or matrix. If not specified, it calculates Pi for the entire data vector.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of Phenotypic Plasticity Index (Pi) values for each trait.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Phenotypic Plasticity Index (Pi), defined as the
difference between the maximum and minimum values of a trait divided by the maximum value.
The function can be applied to multiple traits at once if provided with multiple trait columns.
}
\examples{
df = data.frame(
  Trait1 = c(10, 15, 12, 14, 18),
  Trait2 = c(20, 25, 22, 23, 27),
  Trait3 = c(30, 35, 32, 34, 37)
)
Pi_values = calculate_Phenotypic_Plasticity_Index(df, trait_cols = c("Trait1", "Trait2"))
print(Pi_values)
