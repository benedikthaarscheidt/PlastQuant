\title{Coefficient of Variation of Group Medians (CVmd)}
\usage{
calculate_CVmd(trait_values, group_labels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{Either a **list** of numeric vectors (one per group), or a **numeric vector** of trait measurements.}

\item{group_labels}{(Optional) A vector of the same length as `trait_values` giving the group label for each observation.
Required when `trait_values` is a numeric vector.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value:
\deqn{\mathrm{CVmd} = \frac{\mathrm{sd}(\tilde{x}_g)}{\mathrm{mean}(\tilde{x}_g)},}
where \(\tilde{x}_g\) are the medians of each group.
}
\description{
Computes the Coefficient of Variation of Medians (CVmd), defined as the standard deviation
of group medians divided by their grand mean. You can supply either:

1. A **list** of numeric vectors (each element is one group), or
2. A **numeric vector** of trait values plus a matching **group_labels** vector.
}
\examples{
# As a list of groups:
trait_groups <- list(
  Env1 = c(10, 12, 11),
  Env2 = c(20, 22, 21),
  Env3 = c(15, 18, 17)
)
calculate_CVmd(trait_values = trait_groups)

# As a vector with labels:
traits <- c(10,12,11, 20,22,21, 15,18,17)
labels <- rep(c("Env1","Env2","Env3"), each = 3)
calculate_CVmd(trait_values = traits, group_labels = labels)

}
