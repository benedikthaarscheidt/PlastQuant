\title{Calculate Grand Plasticity (Pi) using Adjusted Means for One or Multiple Traits}
\usage{
calculate_grand_plasticity(
  trait_values,
  env_data,
  covariate_data = NULL,
  control_env = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_data}{A factor or vector representing the environmental conditions (must include control).}

\item{covariate_data}{A numeric vector representing the covariate (e.g., biomass) values.}

\item{control_env}{The label or value in `env_data` that represents the control environment.}

\item{trait_data}{A named list of numeric vectors representing the trait values, one vector per trait.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector where each element represents the grand plasticity (Pi) for a single trait.
}
\description{
This function calculates the grand plasticity (Pi) for specified traits across different treatments,
correcting for a covariate (e.g., size effect like biomass) using adjusted means. The Pi is calculated
as the coefficient of variation (CV) of the adjusted means (standard deviation of adjusted means
divided by the grand mean of adjusted means) across the treatments.
}
\examples{
# Example data
trait_data = list(
  Height = c(10, 12, 20, 22),
  Weight = c(5, 6, 7, 8)
)
env_data = factor(c("Control", "Control", "Treatment1", "Treatment2"))
covariate_data = c(5, 6, 7, 8)  # Covariate (e.g., biomass)
control_env = "Control"

grand_plasticity = calculate_grand_plasticity(
  trait_data = trait_data,
  env_data = env_data,
  covariate_data = covariate_data,
  control_env = control_env
