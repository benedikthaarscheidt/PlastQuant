\title{Calculate the Plasticity Score from a Polynomial Reaction Norm}
\usage{
calculate_plasticity(
  trait_values,
  env_values = NULL,
  max_degree = 3,
  criterion = "BIC"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{A numeric vector representing phenotype values.}

\item{env_values}{(Optional) A numeric vector representing environmental values.
If NULL, equidistant values will be generated.}

\item{max_degree}{The maximum polynomial degree to consider (default is 3).}

\item{criterion}{Selection criterion for model complexity. Options are "AIC" (default) or "BIC".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `best_degree`: The best-fitting polynomial degree.
  - `plasticity_score`: The sum of absolute values of the polynomial coefficients.
  - `coefficients`: The estimated polynomial coefficients for the best model.
}
\description{
This function fits polynomial regression models of varying degrees to describe
the relationship between a phenotype and an environmental gradient.
The best-fitting polynomial is selected using both AIC and BIC criteria, with
a preference for lower-degree models when performance differences are small.
}
\details{
The plasticity score is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the polynomial coefficients.
}
\examples{
trait_values = c(100, 110, 120, 105, 115, 125)
env_values = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

# Calculate Plasticity Score with given environmental values
plasticity_result = calculate_plasticity(trait_values, env_values)
print(plasticity_result)

# Calculate Plasticity Score assuming equidistant environments
plasticity_result_no_env = calculate_plasticity(trait_values)
print(plasticity_result_no_env)
