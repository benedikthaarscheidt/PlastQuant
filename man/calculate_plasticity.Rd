\title{Calculate Plasticity Score from a Polynomial Reaction Norm}
\usage{
calculate_plasticity(
  trait_values,
  env_values = NULL,
  max_degree = 3,
  criterion = "BIC"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{A numeric vector of phenotype values measured across environments.}

\item{env_values}{(Optional) A numeric vector of environmental values corresponding to \code{trait_values}.
If \code{NULL} (default), environments are assumed equidistant and set to \code{1:length(trait_values)}.}

\item{max_degree}{Integer ≥ 1. The maximum polynomial degree to consider in model fitting. Default is 3.}

\item{criterion}{A character string, either \code{"AIC"} or \code{"BIC"}, indicating which information criterion
to use for model selection. Default is \code{"BIC"}.}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{best_degree}}{The degree of the selected polynomial model.}
  \item{\code{plasticity_score}}{The sum of absolute values of the polynomial coefficients (excluding intercept).}
  \item{\code{coefficients}}{A numeric vector of the estimated polynomial coefficients (excluding intercept).}
}
}
\description{
Fits polynomial regression models of degrees 1 through \code{max_degree} to describe the relationship
between a phenotype and an environmental gradient. The best-fitting model is selected based on the
specified information criterion (\code{"AIC"} or \code{"BIC"}), with preference for lower-degree models
when criterion differences are small. The plasticity score is then computed as the sum of the absolute
values of the estimated polynomial coefficients (excluding the intercept).

\examples{
trait_values <- c(100, 110, 120, 105, 115, 125)
env_values   <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

# Default: BIC-based selection
result1 <- calculate_plasticity(trait_values, env_values)
print(result1)

# AIC-based selection, equidistant environments
result2 <- calculate_plasticity(trait_values, max_degree = 4, criterion = "AIC")
print(result2)
