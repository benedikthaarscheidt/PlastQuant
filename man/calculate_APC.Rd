\title{Absolute Plasticity Coefficient (APC) for a Single Trait}
\usage{
calculate_APC(trait_values, env_labels = NULL, sequential_env = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{A numeric vector of trait measurements.}

\item{env_labels}{(Optional) A vector of environment identifiers (numeric, character, or factor) of the same length
as `trait_values`. If `NULL` (default), environments are taken to be `1:length(trait_values)`.}

\item{sequential_env}{Logical; if `TRUE` (default), environments are ordered by their natural/ascending order before
computing means. If `FALSE`, environments are used in the order of first appearance.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value: the APC, or `NA` (with a warning) if fewer than two unique environments are found.
}
\description{
Computes the Absolute Plasticity Coefficient (APC) by averaging the absolute differences
between mean trait values in consecutive environments. If no environment labels are provided,
environments are assumed equidistant (1, 2, â€¦).

The index is defined as:
\deqn{APC = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left| \mu_{i+1} - \mu_i \right|,}
where \(\mu_i\) is the mean trait value in environment \(i\) and \(n\) is the number of unique environments.
}
\examples{
# With explicit environment labels:
trait_values <- c(10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25)
env_labels   <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)
calculate_APC(trait_values, env_labels, sequential_env = TRUE)

# Without env_labels (assumes equidistant environments):
calculate_APC(trait_values)
