\title{Nonlinear Reaction Norm Nonlinearity Score}
\usage{
calculate_reaction_norm_non_linear(trait_values, degree = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{A numeric vector of trait measurements for one genotype
across environments. Must have at least `degree + 1` values and contain no `NA`.}

\item{degree}{An integer ≥ 1 specifying the degree of the polynomial model
to fit (default: 2).}
}
\value{
A single numeric nonlinearity score (sum of absolute non‐intercept
  coefficients), or `NA` if there are insufficient data to fit the model.
}
\description{
Fits a raw‐polynomial regression of trait values on an environmental gradient
and returns a single nonlinearity score, defined as the sum of the absolute
values of all polynomial coefficients beyond the intercept. This provides an
index of how much the reaction norm deviates from linearity.
}
\examples{
# With three data points you can only fit degree 2:
vals <- c(10, 12, 15, 20, 25)
calculate_reaction_norm_non_linear(vals)

# Fit a cubic model instead of default quadratic:
calculate_reaction_norm_non_linear(vals, degree = 3)

# Too few points for degree-4:
calculate_reaction_norm_non_linear(vals, degree = 4)
