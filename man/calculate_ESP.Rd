\title{Calculate Environmental Sensitivity Performance (ESP)}
\usage{
calculate_ESP(trait_values, env_values = NULL, env_subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_values}{A numeric vector representing measured trait values.}

\item{env_values}{(Optional) A numeric vector representing environments. If NULL, assumes equidistant environments.}

\item{env_subset}{(Optional) A vector specifying which environments to include in the calculation. If NULL, all unique environments are used.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing ESP values for each environment.
}
\description{
Computes the Environmental Sensitivity Performance (ESP) for multiple traits across environments.
}
\details{
ESP is calculated as:
\deqn{ESP = \frac{\bar{z}_e - \bar{z}}{\bar{z}}}
where **\(\bar{z}_e\)** is the mean trait value in environment \( e \) and **\(\bar{z}\)** is the overall mean across all environments.

If `env_values` is NULL, environments are assumed to be **equidistant**.
}
\examples{
trait_values = c(10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 25, 30)
env_values = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
calculate_ESP(trait_values, env_values)

}
