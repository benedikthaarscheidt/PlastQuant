Description: Provides functions to simulate synthetic reaction norm data and to quantify phenotypic plasticity.
    Simulation utilities generate linear and nonlinear (Gaussian, sinusoidal, wave) reaction norms for
    multiple genotypes and replicates, with configurable varianceâ€“covariance structure, outlier injection,
    and flexible plotting options. Analysis tools implement a suite of commonly used plasticity metrics
    (e.g., CVt, reaction norm slope, D slope, response coefficient, CVm, CVmd, grand plasticity, PPF,
    Pi, PImd, PILSM, RTR, PIR), transforming trait-by-environment data into interpretable indices. All
    functions are thoroughly documented, include example code, and reference relevant literature for full
    reproducibility.
